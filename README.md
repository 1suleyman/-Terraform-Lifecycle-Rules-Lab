# -Terraform-Lifecycle-Rules-Lab
In this lab, I learned how to control Terraform resource creation and destruction using lifecycle rules, how keepers trigger recreation for random resources, and how to understand the implications of create_before_destroy and prevent_destroy. I also practiced reading state, inspecting resource IDs, and analyzing when new values.
